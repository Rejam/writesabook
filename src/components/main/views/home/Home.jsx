        <p><i>Newcastle Writes a Book</i> is an idea I've had for a fairly long time and after much procrastination I've decided to go for it!</p>

        <p>The idea is to create a book made by the people of Newcastle Upon Tyne. Anyone who would like to be featured in the book can purchase a page for £30.</p>

          <p>You can put absolutely anything you like on your page. A poem you love or wrote, photos you have taken, an advert, perhaps you have written a book and want to put a sample of it! You can place whatever you like - of course all submissions will be reviewed before being approved.</p>

        <p>Secondly, if you didnt want to purchase a whole page, for a smaller donation of £10 you will have your name (or a name of your choice) printed in the back of the book.</p>

        <p>Finally, I will be donating pages to local charities so if you are interested in your charity being listed or you would like to suggest a charity with your donation please do!</p>

        <p>Please share this with anyone you think would be interested!</p>

        <p>If you have any questions please feel free to ask me through this site, or via the Go Fund Me page.</p>
